### Writing code since 1972

I have been programming all my life, since I was 8 years old.

Open for job offers in Copenhagen, writing, testing, debugging, and even
documenting C, C++, Perl, and many other languages. Last 20 years I have been
with Index Data, working with bibliographic data in all its ugly forms. Before
that, and probably soon again, free-lancing very varied kinds of jobs from
microcontrollers to mainframes. These days I prefer Debian Linux, but am not
religious about it.
