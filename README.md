### Writing code since 1972

I have been programming all my life, since I was 8 years old.

Retired programmer in Copenhagen. For 2 decades I used to work
with Index Data, working with bibliographic data in all its ugly forms. Before
that, free-lancing very varied kinds of jobs from
microcontrollers to mainframes. These days I prefer Debian Linux, but am not
religious about it.
